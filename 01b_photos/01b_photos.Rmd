```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Names of files you want
* note this is a file path for Mac. For Windows the path uses \
```{r}
path <- "/Volumes/martonelab/Photos/PTM1700-1799"
```

uses keywords (regex) to find the files containing those characters
| - or

```{r}
photo <- c("PTM1725","PTM1730","PTM1727*")
```

Note: you need to be connected to the Martone Lab server
```{r}
my_files <- photo %>% 
  map(~list.files(path = path,
                  pattern = .,
                  all.files = T,
                  full.names = T))
```

look at the results
```{r}
my_files
```
